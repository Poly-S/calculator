# calculator
Create a repository that contains a calculator object with three methods:

read() (read) requests two values through the readline-sync library and stores them as properties of an object named a and b.
sum() (sum) returns the sum of the stored values.
mul() (multiply) multiplies the stored values and returns the result.
